    Tips for Success
</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Target cover &amp; structure</strong> – Bass in sloughs and rivers love weed beds, fallen logs, bridges, and pilings 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Best lures</strong> – Use soft plastics (Senkos, creature baits), small crankbaits, jigs, spinnerbaits, or top‑water lures depending on conditions 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Ideal seasons</strong> – Late spring through early fall offers peak warmwater fishing; trout stocking in spring and fall adds angler variety 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>No boat? No problem</strong> – Many spots have excellent bank access. Float tubes or small craft expand your reach.
