    Introduction to Steelhead Fishing near Salem, Oregon
</h2>
<p>
    When it comes to freshwater angling in the Pacific Northwest, <strong>steelhead fishing near Salem, Oregon</strong> is a prized pursuit. These ocean-going rainbow trout are known for their strength, stamina, and elusive nature, drawing passionate anglers from across the region.

</p>
<h2>
    What Are Steelhead? (Understanding the Species)
</h2>
<p>
    Steelhead are the <strong>anadromous form of rainbow trout</strong>, meaning they hatch in freshwater streams, migrate to the ocean, and return to spawn in rivers. Unlike salmon, steelhead can survive after spawning and may return to the ocean and come back multiple times.
</p>
<p>
    There are two main runs:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Winter Steelhead</strong>: Typically arrive from December through April.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Summer Steelhead</strong>: Arrive from May through October, often traveling farther upstream.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These fish are known for their explosive runs, leaping acrobatics, and challenging nature—making them one of the most rewarding fish to pursue in Oregon waters.
