<h2>
    Stocked vs Wild Trout in Oregon Waters
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Stocked Trout</strong>: Raised in hatcheries and released into lakes and rivers. Usually marked with a clipped adipose fin.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Wild Trout</strong>: Naturally born in rivers. Often must be released (check local regs).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Fishing for both is rewarding, but wild trout provide a special challenge and should be handled with care.
