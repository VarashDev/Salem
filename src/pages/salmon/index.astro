<h2>
    Best Times of Year for Salmon Fishing

        <strong>Spring Chinook (March–June)</strong>: These early runs are prized for their flavor and size.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Fall Chinook (August–October)</strong>: The most popular season with heavy action on the North Santiam and Willamette Rivers.
