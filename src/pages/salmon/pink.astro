<h2>
    Introduction to Pink Salmon
</h2>
<p>
    Pink salmon, also known as humpback salmon, are the smallest species in the Pacific salmon family. Their life cycle spans two years, which is why they return to spawn every odd-numbered year—including 2025.
</p>
<p>
    They're easily recognizable by their light pink hue and the distinct hump males develop during spawning. These fish migrate from the Pacific Ocean into Oregon’s rivers to spawn, making inland areas like Salem ideal for freshwater fishing action during their brief return.
</p>
<h2>
    2025 Pink Salmon Run Forecast
</h2>
<p>
    This year’s pink salmon run near Salem is expected to begin in <strong>early August</strong>, with numbers peaking in <strong>late August to early September</strong>. According to recent <strong>ODFW (Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife)</strong> projections, the return looks promising, thanks to cooler ocean temperatures and improved juvenile survival rates in the past cycle.
</p>
<p>
    Stay updated via the ODFW Fishing Report for weekly salmon run updates and river conditions.

<h2>
    When to Fish for Pink Salmon
</h2>
<p>
    The pink salmon season in Oregon typically starts in <strong>August</strong> and runs through <strong>early October</strong>. The best time to fish is:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Early Morning</strong>: 6 AM to 9 AM
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Late Afternoon</strong>: 4 PM to dusk
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    During cloudy days or after a light rain, pinks become more active, especially in shaded river sections.
</p>
<h2>
    Daily and Weekly Tides and Timing
</h2>
<p>
    Though Salem isn’t tidal, the timing of fish movement upstream is often tied to ocean tides. Pink salmon surge into river mouths during high tides and continue their journey inland for days after.
</p>
<p>
    Use tools like <strong>Tide Charts</strong> for Astoria or Newport to predict when pushes of salmon might reach upriver zones.
</p>
<h2>

    Proven Techniques for Catching Pinks
